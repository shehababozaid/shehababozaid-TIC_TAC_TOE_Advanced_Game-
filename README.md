# Tic-Tac-Toe Advanced Game

## Overview

This project presents an advanced implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, developed using C++. It features robust user authentication, personalized game history tracking, and a sophisticated AI opponent. The game supports both player-versus-player and player-versus-AI modes, adhering to modern software engineering best practices for secure user management, rigorous testing, and professional version control.

## Objectives

*   **Interactive Gameplay:** Deliver an engaging Tic-Tac-Toe experience with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI).
*   **User Management:** Implement secure user authentication to manage player profiles and maintain individual game histories.
*   **Intelligent AI Opponent:** Integrate an advanced AI capable of strategic decision-making.
*   **Quality Assurance:** Ensure software reliability and stability through comprehensive unit and integration testing.
*   **Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD):** Utilize GitHub Actions for automated testing and streamlined deployment processes.

## Core Components

*   **Game Logic:** Manages fundamental game mechanics for both two-player and AI modes, including move validation, win condition checks, and tie detection.
*   **AI Opponent:** Employs the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to enable strategic and challenging AI gameplay.
*   **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Provides an intuitive user interface for game interaction, user session management, and visual feedback.
*   **User Authentication:** A secure system for user registration and login, incorporating robust password hashing.
*   **Game History:** Stores and allows retrieval of detailed game session information for each user.
*   **Testing:** Comprehensive unit and integration tests developed using the QT Test framework.
*   **CI/CD:** Automated workflows for testing and deployment orchestrated via GitHub Actions.

## Implementation Details

*   **Programming Language:** C++ (Object-Oriented Programming)
*   **Testing Framework:** QT Test
*   **Version Control:** Git (GitHub)
*   **Database:** SQLite (for local data persistence)
*   **Security:** Secure hashing algorithms for password protection
*   **GUI Framework:** Qt libraries

## Data Structures

*   **Minimax Algorithm:** Utilizes tree structures for AI decision-making processes.
*   **Other:** Employs various data structures such as stacks, hash tables, and linked lists for efficient data management.
